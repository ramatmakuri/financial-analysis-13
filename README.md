# Basic VC Funding Analysis using Neural Networks

In this assignment, financial Python programming skills will be used with machine learning and neural netwroks to predict whether a startup will be successful using a binary classifier model. 

For this purpose, I will train the neural network using a CSV file containing information on more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. 

Data source: CSV file

The steps followed are:

1. Preprocess data for a neural network model.

2. Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.

3. Optimize the model.

Packages Used This project leverages python 3.7

Installation Guide: The application requires the below programs to be installed

Python
Pandas
Numpy
SKlearn
Tensorflow
